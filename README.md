Add Cuda version for GPUs Course at NYU: Parallel Ray Tracing with Cuda\
**Team Member:** Hanlin He, Yaowei Zong, Wenbo Song

## Source Code

**Intent**\
This repository is the skeleton of a ray tracer which will be modified to a parallel version as the final project of Multicore Processor Fall 2021 at NYU.\
\
**Downloading The Source Code**\
This project is mostly writen in C++, to clone the repository, you can

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:HerlinHe/Multicore_ParallelRayTracing.git
```

Remember to create a new brach when you do your part of work.\
\
**Build and Run**\
The OpenMP version located in the directory ```cpu_openMP```. You need create a ```build``` directory in the root and run program there, do not generate binary file outside of it.

To test on NYU CIMS `crunchy1.cims.nyu.edu` server, first load `cmake` and `gcc`:
```zsh
module load cmake-3
module load gcc-11.2
```

```zsh
cd cpu_openMP
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<Your G++ Compiler> ..
make
./parallel_ray_tracing <number of threads> [--width] [--sample] [--depth]
```

```
# a sample execution with optional args:
./parallel_ray_tracing 16 --width=1200 --sample=100 --depth=5
```


Making ```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``` to ```Release``` then you can accelerate your program.

The option ```-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``` specify your compiler, you should choose g++ which support openMP. If not specify the compiler, it will use your default compiler and may cause "Undefined symbols" error. The g++ version I use is g++11.\
\
**What You should Get**\
If you choose ```world=random_scene()```(default option) in the ```main``` function and set `--width=1200`, then you can get the following image following the instruction.

!["Image Missing"](img/image.png?raw=true)

A more complicated scene can be rendered when you set ```world=final_scene()``` in the ```main``` function. It takes about 160mins to render this picture with one thread.

**Compare with GPU Version**\
We also add a GPU version using Cuda in the directory ```gpu_cuda```. The implemention refer to ```https://github.com/idcrook/weeker_raytracer```.

```zsh
cd gpu_cuda
cmake -B build
cd build
make
./parallel_cuda > out.ppm
```

To convert the ppm file into a picturen you can
```zsh
ppmtojpeg out.ppm > out.jpg
```
To produce the first scene, the GPU version takes several seconds, which is much faster than CPU one.
